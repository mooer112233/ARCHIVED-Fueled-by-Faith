		    <p style="line-height: 0px"><font size="3"><!--<span>-->27 Jul 2017<!--</span>--><font></p>
			<i><font size="1"><h2><blockquote><em>Ruth was an Old Testament woman who was tested and always remained loyal and in the end she was greatly rewarded for it.</em></blockquote></h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doesn't that sound awesome? I mean the end part does, being greatly rewarded, but the thing is, we have to go through the trials and tribulations to get what we desire. We have to delight yourselves in The Lord and He will give us the desires of our hearts (Psalm 37:4). So what exactly did Ruth do? Well, about ten years after getting married her husband, brother-in-law, and father-in-law all passed away. Her mother-in-law decided to move back home. On the journey she had a change of heart and told her daughters-in-law to return home because they may not be accepted in her homeland. The one returned but Ruth clung to her mother-in-law and refused to leave her. After living there for a little Ruth took the initiative and went to find God by going out and finding work to help her mother-in-law. While she was out working she met Boaz, a man to showed her incredible grace and noble character. Eventually Ruth and Boaz get married and they have a son who makes her mother-in-law extremely joyful. So you see, Ruth showed incredible loyalty and obedience to her mother-in-law and to God.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are twelve characteristics that Ruth has that we as modern day woman (and men) should strive to have and also where in the Bible God tells us to be like this:</em></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Kindness (Proverbs 31:26)</h2>

<p style="font-size: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We always have to show kindness and we should not expect it in return. We have to chose to have a gentle spirit and show grace to others because of the grace that has been shown to us through Jesus and the sacrifice he made for us by dying on the Cross for our salvation.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Loving (1 Peter 4:8)</h2>

<p style="font-size: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are full of love for The Lord just like Ruth so why shouldn't we be filled with love for others! Jesus loves all and showed it throughout His life. So everything we do should be done through love. I know it's hard to be loving to people who call you names or are rude, but if they are acting that way then they need a little extra love. So why not be the person who shows that love?</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Peaceful (Isaiah 26:3)</h2>

<p style="font-size: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's hard to be at peace when it feels like the world and Satan are pulling you down. But just as Ruth, we need to chose peace over worry. If we keep our focus on the Prince of Peace then in return He will give our hearts the peace we need to continue.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Delightful in The Father (Psalm 37:4)</h2>

<p style="font-size: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to trust in the Lord 100% and be proud to call ourselves children of the One True God. We can trust that if we go as He asks, He will fulfill the desires He created us to have. If we follow Him and His will we will be eternally blessed because we have chosen to follow Him.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Pure heart (Matthew 5:8)</h2>

<p style="font-size: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything we do should be to build others up and not to tear them down. They are also a child of God. He created them just like you and me and they should be treated as such. We should ask God daily to purify our minds and our hearts so at night we can lay our heads on our pillows and that we are walking in the will of our Father.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Walk in faith (Luke 1:45)</h2>

<p style="font-size: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of walking, we should walk in faith and not be afraid to dream big! We can lay our requests in the hands of our Father and know that He will choose what is best for us, even if we don't like the answer. We hold onto the promises from God. He if sees it fit, He will give it to us.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Understands their worth in Christ (Psalm 139:14)</h2>

<p style="font-size: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We embrace the beauty and the blemishes that God has blessed us with in a culture that tells us we shouldn't. We go against the grain and believe what is true. We have mastered the art of loving ourselves because God has shown us and we have to teach others to love themselves through Christ as well. We choose to see ourselves through the eyes of God.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Lets their inner beauty shine (1 Peter 3:3-4)</h2>

<p style="font-size: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We understand that the beauty of our hearts needs to radiate outwards. It does not matter the size of the blemish on our forehead because we know true beauty comes from within.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Devotion (Ruth 1:16-17)</h2>

<p style="font-size: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even through the bad we need to be devoted to God. We have to trust in our hearts that He has a plan for us (Jeremiah 29:11) and we have to trust that He will bring us to where He needs us to be. Ruth's devotion is an example for everyone.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Wisdom (Proverbs 31:26)</h2>

<p style="font-size: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak from what you know not from what you hear. Speak from wisdom not from ignorance. You won't know everything and that's okay because you know what? That's God's job, not ours. </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Integrity (Titus 2:7-8)</h2>

<p style="font-size: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honesty is the best policy, am I right? Even though telling the truth may be hard, it is always better in the long run. God is always honest with us, it keeps us from having hurting and broken hearts. We are told to strive and be like Jesus, and if He is honest with us, why shouldn't we be honest with others? We want to pass this trait on and show the honesty and how good God is.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Strength (Proverbs 31:25)</h2>

<p style="font-size: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like Ruth, we will face heartache and disappointment. It's because of the world we live in. However, we have to be strong and know the God has us and He is in control. She can laugh at the days to come because she doesn't live in fear because God has her in the palms of His gracious hands. That's the epheme of strength, letting your heartbreak make you better instead of bitter.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Joyful (Psalm 144:15)</h2>

<p style="font-size: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The devil has already been defeated. We can rejoice because we know our God has won! We need to walk in victory. God will work everything out in our good so why need to worry? Be happy! Do you know why we can face the future without and worry? Because God is on our side. If that doesn't make you want to get up and rejoice, well then I'm not sure what will.</p>

		    <p style="line-height: 0px"><font size="3"><!--<span>-->24 Jul 2017<!--</span>--><font></p>
			<i><font size="1"><h2><blockquote><p><em>“Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.”</em></p> 
		<blockquote><p>Proverbs‬ ‭3:5–6‬ ‭ESV‬‬</p>
		</blockquote>
</blockquote></h2>

<p>Trust in the Lord your God with all your heart. Sometimes it’s hard to trust our own decisions with our entire heart, let alone give it up to something we can’t see. Faith plays an intricate role in decision-making. Here’s the problem:</p>

<h2><strong>We think we can do <em>it</em> alone.</strong></h2>

<p>What is <em>it</em>? Our <em>it</em> is whatever decision, plan, choice, et cetera we think we have total control over, almost as if we know exactly how our life will pan out after said decision. Here’s the catch  —  we don’t.</p>

<p>Proverbs 3:5–6 has become my “life-verse” for 2017 after the giant message that is deciding on a college. I had two options: College A was second in the nation for my major, I was accepted in October, visited at least 4 times, and guaranteed me a career in and after my time there. I visited College B on a school band trip to a music clinic for my first time, I knew little about, and it was already May and I was changing my mind. Did I mention that College B was a private Christian school? See, I felt a calling  —  a Christ-powered conviction  —  to at least apply to College B. Being so late I figured it’d be a sluggish, bothersome, and overall fruitless process, though, I was still excited.</p>

<p>I’ll get back to the college thing in a second, but I wanted to throw in the whole Proverbs 3:5–6 life-verse part into the story. In my local Youth Group, we were working through Scripture on trusting God with everything (starting to tie in?) and during the aforementioned band trip, we saw Jonah at the renowned Sight &amp; Sound Theater, a pretty impressive show if you ask me. Well, it was before this show that I was meandering through the gift shop  —  not planning to buy, just killing time before the show  —  and I see a granite cross decoration with Proverbs 3:5–6 inscribed on it. Now to me, this was an instant moment of “sacred echoes”  —  the thing that seems like God’s version of deja vu. Well, I ended up skipping out on that little piece, though I’d been looking for a piece to fill a gap on my desk, something that I could use as a focus when things got rough. Long story short, I got it on Amazon for half the cost because gift shops are overpriced. It was very odd, truly, that this verse  —  trust God with everything, don’t trust yourself, seek Him, and He’ll show you what to do  —  happened to come up, be brought to my attention, and resonated with my soul so perfectly in the moment I was struggling with this conviction over college. All because of a marching band trip and cheap, Chinese-made decor happening to cross paths at the perfect time.</p>

<p>So, I ended up applying for College B, had my fee waived, the rolling deadline allowed me an easy process, and they had my major. Something seemed a bit perfect here. This got me excited, and when I get excited I like to share it with people. Therefore, I confided this change of heart with my best friend who, in fact, was struggling with college decisions themselves. You see, they were just chasing after the status quo and standards set for them by others. My excitement got them excited. From my excited state transferring to them, they ended up branching out  —  applying to multiple Christian universities for majors in ministry that their original community college just didn’t offer. I eventually found that College B wasn’t feasible for me, and went back to College A where I found a calling in spiritual life there.</p>

<p>So what’s the point to this convoluted and anticlimactic story? Without me trusting solely in God, someone else might have missed out on their calling. By serving God, I was serving a sister-in-Christ. You see, God doesn’t just call the equipped to do His work here on Earth, rather, He equips the called to fulfill His divine purpose. Both of us are set for paths of success in ways that we never expected. I’m sure you’ve heard the common saying, “Well gee, God sure does work in mysterious ways.” God can work in anyone, anyway as long as we put our full trust in Him and His will.</p>

<p>Don’t miss out when you feel God’s conviction, He doesn’t need you to do your <em>it</em>, as He can most certainly find someone else from 7 billion people in His own image. As Jesus asked Peter to step out from the boat onto the water (Matthew 14:29) in an act of faith, we need to trust that Christ will care for us enough to make our paths straight.</p>

<p>Are there any convictions you’re wrestling with lately? Is God calling you towards something and you just need to step from your boat? Jesus is holding out His hand.</p>
