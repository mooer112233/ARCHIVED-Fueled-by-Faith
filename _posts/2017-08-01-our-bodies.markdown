So if God created us in *His* image for *His* perfect plan, then do we really own our bodies? Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 6:19, "you are not your own." That seems like a rather explicit and straightforward answer. One mistruth that's been circulated since ancient Greek philosophers is the idea that "my body is worldy/evil; I can divorce it from my spirituality. It doesn't matter if I mess it up." However, the Bible tells us the complete opposite. As aforementioned, our body is a **Temple of God**, and Paul tells us "If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For God's temple is holy, and you are that temple."(1 Cor 3:17) So what does the Bible say about negative habits we give into with our bodies?

## Speech
Vulgarity, gossip, negativity, and hate are a few examples "filthiness" and "foolishness" as Ephesians 5:4 puts it. Ephesians 4:29, Colossians 4:6, and Proverbs 15:1-2 are all passages related to our daily speech. 

> *It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person.”*
>> -Matthew 15:11

## What We Put In
This has a lot to do with drugs, alcohol, and food. Of course, the world has two very different perspectives on these topics: put in whatever you want or put in none of it. God's Word supports the latter. On the subject of food, God blesses us with the ability to enjoy food. However, if food consumes our mind or distracts us from God, we need to reconsider our priorities. Proverbs 20:1, 1 Corinthians 10:31, Romans 12:2, and Proverbs 23:2 give insight to God's opinion on what we put into our bodies.

> *"Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour."*
>>1 Peter 5:8

## Sexual Immorality
Being in such a relationship-centered culture, sex is worshiped and encouraged by many young adults. Lust for sexual immorality is a strong temptation that is extremely prevail today, but the Bible offers great advice for staying pure: Psalms 119 9-16, a Psalm of Beth.
> *"How can a young man keep his way pure?
By guarding it according to your word."*
>> -Psalms 119:9

God created our bodies. Our bodies belong to **Him** not **us**. Therefore, we need to be stewards of God's creation - us. If we don't take care of our bodies, we don't glorify God, and we don't resemble **Generation Jesus**.
