> -1 Peter 5:8

Think of a tattered, burnt, ugly scroll advertising "God's not good!" This is a pretty good representation of sin -- specifically temptation. Naturally as fallen men, we're drawn to the world as it tells us "God doesn't rally want what's best for you. He just wants control over your life with His rules. That lust, that porn, that addiction, that *whatever else* is better than whatever God may be telling you to do." One thing is definitely true: sin is **desirable, fun, and explicitly against God's word.** If sin were undesirable, we *probably* wouldn't have an issue resisting it. Satan repeatedly tells us that "*this* is good for you." We're warned about this in 1 Peter 5:8. Directly after that, however, comes pretty important advice. Peter reminds us to be sober-minded and watchful, and also to resist Satan and firm our faith (1 Peter 5:9).

While most of what and where temptation is may be obvious, *avoiding* it is a whole other story. Step 1: prayer. Unceasing prayer about all things -- nothing is too trivial for God -- sets us in the right mindset as we go about our lives. Step 2: questioning. Rather than thinking "is this good for me," remove the world from your mind and think "is **God** good for me." The answer is undoubtedly *yes,* but why? James 1:16-17 reminds us that "every good thing comes down from the father..." So in order for whatever *thing* you struggle with to be good for you, **it has to come from God,** as He's what's good for you.

Let's face it, we live in a fallen world. Sin and temptation run rampant through our lives. However, with the help of an Advocate (John 14:16), we can continue to run towards the light of Heaven. Breaking past the desire of temptation can be hard. Sometimes, we don't even realize sin's full effect until it's gone too far. God -- purely out of his abounding grace and love -- has redeemed us through Jesus Christ (1 Cor 1:30) so that we don't have to suffer. Once we fall, we're expected to move past it. "You were bought with a price, do not become slaves of men" (1 Corinthians 7:23).
