<blockqutoe>Ruth was an Old Testament woman who was tested and always remained loyal and in the end she was greatly rewarded for it. Doesn’t that sound awesome?</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean the end part does, being greatly rewarded, but the thing is, we have to go through the trials and tribulations to get what we desire. We have to delight yourselves in The Lord and He will give us the desires of our hearts (Psalm 37:4). So what exactly did Ruth do? Well, about ten years after getting married her husband, brother-in-law, and father-in-law all passed away. Her mother-in-law decided to move back home. On the journey she had a change of heart and told her daughters-in-law to return home because they may not be accepted in her homeland. The one returned but Ruth clung to her mother-in-law and refused to leave her. After living there for a little Ruth took the initiative and went to find God by going out and finding work to help her mother-in-law. While she was out working she met Boaz, a man to showed her incredible grace and noble character. Eventually Ruth and Boaz get married and they have a son who makes her mother-in-law extremely joyful. So you see, Ruth showed incredible loyalty and obedience to her mother-in-law and to God.</p> 

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Here are twelve characteristics that Ruth has that we as modern day woman (and men) should strive to have and also where in the Bible God tells us to be like this:</em></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Kindness (Proverbs 31:26)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We always have to show kindness and we should not expect it in return. We have to chose to have a gentle spirit and show grace to others because of the grace that has been shown to us through Jesus and the sacrifice he made for us by dying on the Cross for our salvation.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Loving (1 Peter 4:8)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are full of love for The Lord just like Ruth so why shouldn’t we be filled with love for others! Jesus loves all and showed it throughout His life. So everything we do should be done through love. I know it’s hard to be loving to people who call you names or are rude, but if they are acting that way then they need a little extra love. So why not be the person who shows that love?</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Peaceful (Isaiah 26:3)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s hard to be at peace when it feels like the world and Satan are pulling you down. But just as Ruth, we need to chose peace over worry. If we keep our focus on the Prince of Peace then in return He will give our hearts the peace we need to continue.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Delightful in The Father (Psalm 37:4)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to trust in the Lord 100% and be proud to call ourselves children of the One True God. We can trust that if we go as He asks, He will fulfill the desires He created us to have. If we follow Him and His will we will be eternally blessed because we have chosen to follow Him.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Pure heart (Matthew 5:8)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything we do should be to build others up and not to tear them down. They are also a child of God. He created them just like you and me and they should be treated as such. We should ask God daily to purify our minds and our hearts so at night we can lay our heads on our pillows and that we are walking in the will of our Father.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Walk in faith (Luke 1:45)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of walking, we should walk in faith and not be afraid to dream big! We can lay our requests in the hands of our Father and know that He will choose what is best for us, even if we don’t like the answer. We hold onto the promises from God. He if sees it fit, He will give it to us.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Understand your worth in Christ (Psalm 139:14)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We embrace the beauty and the blemishes that God has blessed us with in a culture that tells us we shouldn’t. We go against the grain and believe what is true. We have mastered the art of loving ourselves because God has shown us and we have to teach others to love themselves through Christ as well. We choose to see ourselves through the eyes of God.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Let your inner beauty shine (1 Peter 3:3-4)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We understand that the beauty of our hearts needs to radiate outwards. It does not matter the size of the blemish on our forehead because we know true beauty comes from within.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Devotion (Ruth 1:16-17)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even through the bad we need to be devoted to God. We have to trust in our hearts that He has a plan for us (Jeremiah 29:11) and we have to trust that He will bring us to where He needs us to be. Ruth’s devotion is an example for everyone.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Wise (Proverbs 31:26)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak from what you know not from what you hear. Speak from wisdom not from ignorance. You won’t know everything and that’s okay because you know what? That’s God’s job, not ours. </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Integrity (Titus 2:7-8)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honesty is the best policy, am I right? Even though telling the truth may be hard, it is always better in the long run. God is always honest with us, it keeps us from having hurting and broken hearts. We are told to strive and be like Jesus, and if He is honest with us, why shouldn’t we be honest with others? We want to pass this trait on and show the honesty and how good God is.</p>
    
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Strong (Proverbs 31:25)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like Ruth, we will face heartache and disappointment. It’s because of the world we live in. However, we have to be strong and know the God has us and He is in control. She can laugh at the days to come because she doesn’t live in fear because God has her in the palms of His gracious hands. That’s the epheme of strength, letting your heartbreak make you better instead of bitter.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Joyful (Psalm 144:15)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The devil has already been defeated. We can rejoice because we know our God has won! We need to walk in victory. God will work everything out in our good so why need to worry? Be happy! Do you know why we can face the future without and worry? Because God is on our side. If that doesn’t make you want to get up and rejoice, well then I’m not sure what will.</p>
