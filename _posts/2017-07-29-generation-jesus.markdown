> ## "This is what's wrong with our generation..."

In this new series, *Generation Jesus*, we're going to look at some of the problems ad confusion we have, as well as the answers and truths. I don't believe we're necessarily a *bad* generation, but instead, we're an *influenced* generation. Influenced by the World through Satan.

To start things off, I should introduce myself in a way that reveals my place and perspective of the world. My name is Ryan, and I'm an 18 year old believer - born again from Atheism. Being born in 1999, my place in the whole "generation spectrum" is pretty unclear (though, the actual start/stop dates for the generations are unclear themselves) as I'm stuck between Millennials and Generation Z. I was born and raised in a small, conservative town in Western Pennsylvania, and I would most definitely agree to the fact that I'm sheltered from much of the culture that is the "problem."

In this series, I plan on covering a few different topics such as gender roles, gender identity, use of our bodies, and our attitudes.
