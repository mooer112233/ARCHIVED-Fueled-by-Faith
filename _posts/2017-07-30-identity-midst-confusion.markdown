&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before even your *parents* thought of you, God had every single detail of you, mapped out exactly how He wanted. In fact, He also perfected your parents genetic makeup, and *their parents* genetic makeup - and so on - so that you'd become exactly who you are in this very instant. He cared so much for you, that He perfected you and made you in the image of Himself, God; giving you so much purpose, uniqueness, and personal identity only because He wholly loves you. Take a second and re-read that paragraph and see if you can even begin to grasp the massive scale of God's grand design.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With so much care to perfect you and make you who you are, you'd think it would be hard to question *who* and *what* you are. Unfortunately, this seems to be becoming more and more of an issue as time progresses. What's thought to be "self expression" by some, seems to be "mental illness" by others. So what does God say about you and your uniqueness? I mean, He took so much effort to create you, so it's pretty important to get His opinion on the matter. Yesterday, we started with a passage from Genesis: "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them."(Gen 1:27) So right off the bat, God's establishing two things:

1. We're made in His perfect image and

2. He created us as male and female.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a pretty strong start, right? If His image and plan is perfect, and He chose to make us male and female, it's straightforward. Role-wise, men  and women were expected to be different, but what about changing gender? "A woman shall not wear a man's garment, nor shall a man put on a woman's cloak, for whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord your God."(Deu 22:5) This verse in Deuteronomy shows crossing lines between femininity and masculinity when dressing as an abomination. However, much of the Bible contains symbolic phrases. Deuteronomy 22:5 seems to also lay the groundworks for impersonating the other gender in any regard as an abomination. The question still remains, however, "is transgenderism a sin?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we know God wants us to be us, because He planned for us to be the way we are. What happens when we do travel down the path of confusion? Is it part of God's grand design, or just another ploy of Satan to distract (and literally confuse) us from the Glory of God? Before we dive any deeper into the matter, we need to accurate define sin in a Biblical context. 1 John 3:4 provides a basis on the definition of sin. Using the Hebrew text to hear the original meaning, we read...

> "Everyone who practices **hamartía** - sin; to miss the mark (the "mark" is God's perfect plan) - also practices **anomia** - lawlessness; wickedness - and sin is lawlessness."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Sin* is anything that is wicked and everything that falls short of **God's perfect plan.** By violating His plan for our creation, we're violating God's plan, and that is the definition of **sin.** Fortunately, there's hope. Our God is a graceful and loving God.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are in that boat of confusion, you're probably ready to clock out right now - you probably think I'm pretentiously judging you based off of your decision amidst confusion. I would like to tell you the complete **opposite.** As brothers and sisters in Christ, we get the privilege to stand next to each other as believers no matter how far or how hard we've fallen. *We all fall, and we all get lost.* God still loves you unconditionally. Despite what decisions you make here, it'll all be forgotten in the Kingdom of Heaven. Paul reminds us this in Galatians 3:28, "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." Spiritually, God sees us as equals, as *saved* or *not saved.* If, despite the mist Satan shrouds us all with, we push through adversity and sin and we "confess with our mouths" and "believe in our hearts" that Jesus Christ is the resurrected King(Rom 10:9), He'll be our advocate come Judgement Day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I leave you with this: a confusing time is a confusing subject. It's hard to find God's meaning when the word "transgender" isn't even used in Biblical text, and all opinions can be laced with human opinion and Satan's lies. I feel as though this Biblical analysis only touches the basic ideas of the confusion of transgenderism. If you have any more to add, questions, or any points to ponder please leave them below in the comment section. Thank you for your support and keep striving to become **Generation Jesus.**
