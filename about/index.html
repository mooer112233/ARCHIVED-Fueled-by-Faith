	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to Fueled by Faith - a project by Ryan W. Moore. Check out his, and other authors' testimonies <a href="/testimony">here</a>.</p>
	
	<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Our Misson</em></strong></h2>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our mission here at Fueled by Faith is simply this: futher God's Kingdom, make disciples, and strengthen faith. Together, as the living body of Chirst, we take on this mission with no mental-reservastion or hesitancy. All of this is for God's Glory.</p>
		
	<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Our Start</em></strong></h2>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without any prior coding knowledge, blogging experience, or even a final image - Ryan began putting together the framework for this blog July 24, 2017. The saying, "God doesn't called the equipped, he equips the called," really rang true. The idea started as a simple need to journal thoughts and eventually manifested into the website you see today. As we continue to grow, diversify our image, and develop the website, we'd love to hear your opinions, testimonies, and feedback!
