&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The apostle Paul - stuck in a prison for loving what he once hated - advises us to be like Christ. A man, broken and imprisoned, continually gives words of encouragement to the members of his broken churches. Talk about a good attitude!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to our last installment of Generation Jesus. We're going to talk about the importance of attitude and what God has to say about it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Ephesians 5:1, Paul challenges us to "be imitators of God, as beloved children." That's a pretty tall order to fill considering God's almighty, everlasting reach over all of creation - which He created. However, even though Jesus' sole mission was to shed blood for our salvation, Jesus also was placed on Earth to be our perfect example of godly living. It's a bit more realistic to copy a man, right?
