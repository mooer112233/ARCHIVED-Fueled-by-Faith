Imagine this: A divine, perfect, all-powerful God creating literally *everything*. Huge right? Imagine He deemed all of this creation *"good."* That's good right? King of the universe saying it's all good is cool and all, but it gets way cooler. After all of this creating, He felt compelled to create *US, *man and woman (Adam's name literally translates to *man* in Hebrew). Not only did he create us, but he called us *"very good." *Isn't that intense? Our God made the most intense, beautiful, vibrant, and wondrous nature, but considered it only **good **compared to our **very good***.*
