	<h2 style="text-align: left;"> Part One: Before Christ</h2>
		<p style="left-margin: 25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grew up in the church, my family was very involved, my father was even the youth pastor, but I had no idea who “God” was. I thought He was just a guy up in the clouds who was bowling when it thundered. Growing up there were a lot of issues, abuse, divorce, court, and through it all the adults in my life would fall to their knees and pray and I would always one eye to see what everyone else was doing. I only “followed God” because that’s what everyone around me was doing. But I wasn’t doing what I should have been doing. I lived a life full of looking for affection in all of the wrong places. Bouncing from boy to boy and giving way to much of myself.</p>
	
	<h2 style="text-align: left;"> Part Two: Finding Christ</h2>
		<p style="left-margin: 25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After years of self harm, self loathing, and horrible self esteem I decided to go to therapy. No matter what the issue was she would always bring it back to God. Giving me hope that He would bring me through every situation. This past May I went to an all girl’s conference at a local church called “Beloved”. There Marsha Reeder gave us her testimony and how her life was changed by Christ’s love and redemption. Sitting in the sanctuary of a church I had never been to I felt lead to share my story and the call to further God’s kingdom through ministry.</p>
		
	<h2 style="text-align: left;"> Part Three: Life with Christ</h2>
		<p style="left-margin: 25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I love  myself. I don’t need a full face of makeup to go out (I’m not saying makeup is a bad thing, do what makes you comfortable). I don’t need satisfaction from others. I know God for who He truly is, a loving, caring, intimate God. I don’t need boys or makeup to feel beautiful. I don’t go to bed crying anymore because of the choices I made during the day. I know that I am saved by the blood of Jesus Christ and that God loves me. He knows there will be bumps in the road but as Marsha Reeder puts it, “God hugs us and says ‘Yeah it hurt Me too, but we’ll get through it.’” I know now that God put me here for a reason and it’s my job to live it out.
