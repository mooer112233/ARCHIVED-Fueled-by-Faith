	<blockquote><em>Everything I am and everything that I have is because of Jesus Christ and His immeasurable love.</em></blockquote>	
	
	<p style="left-margin: 25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My testimony is rather a simple.  I was blessed to have grown up in a Christian home all of my life with two loving parents and three older brothers.  Since birth, I attended a small church in Western Pennsylvania.  When I turned eight years old, I made Jesus Christ Lord of my life by asking Him to be my Savior and direct my life.  It was on that day that my life forever changed!
</p>
	
	<p style="left-margin: 25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since that holy encounter, I have continued to pursue an intimate and growing relationship with Jesus Christ.  Without a doubt, I have experienced tough moments and trials throughout my spiritual journey.  The Lord has blessed me tremendously, and I am so thankful for His hand upon my life.  
</p>
	
	<p style="left-margin: 25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been moments in my journey that I have questioned whether or not I have a testimony worth sharing.  Satan has tried to twist God's truth into making me believe that because I do not have a big and eventful story of how I came to Christ, I don't have a testimony worth sharing.  With that being said, the Lord has affirmed to me that anyone who has experienced the love of Jesus Christ has a story worth telling.  I am, after all, for His glory!

	<p style="left-margin: 25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My family and I grew up attending a church camp in Western Pennsylvania called Whitehall Camp and Conference Center.  This campground has had a tremendous impact on my spiritual journey and call to ministry.  When I turned sixteen years old, I felt God calling me to work full time at this camp on the Summer Ministry Team.  It was during that summer that I believe God began to reveal passions and desires that He has given me to be involved with full time ministry.
</p>
	
	<p style="left-margin: 25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God continued to affirm my call to ministry during the next two terms that I served at this campground on staff.  It was during my senior year of high school that I decided to wholeheartedly surrender my plans and choose to begin the journey towards becoming a teacher of God's Word.  
</p>
	
	<p style="left-margin: 25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After much prayer and petitioning, I took a huge leap of faith and said yes to God's call and nudging for me to study as an undergraduate student at a Christian school in Anderson, Indiana.  After graduating from college, God led me to serve in a church as the Associate, Youth Pastor back in Western Pennsylvania.  The Lord has continued to prove His faithfulness and His goodness to me everyday of my spiritual journey.
</p>
	
	<p style="left-margin: 25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every day, I have to remind myself to surrender my plans, dreams and timeline to the Lord.  I am learning that His plan truly is best.  Itâ€™s not always easy, but letting go and letting Him work in my heart is always worth the inner work.  Throughout every season of life, I know that I have not been alone for He has been with me each step of the way.  Praise God for His absurd provision for my life!
