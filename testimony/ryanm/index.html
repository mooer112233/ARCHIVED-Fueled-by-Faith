	<h2 style="text-align: left;"> Part One: Before Christ</h2>
		<p style="left-margin: 25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was an Athiest. Seventeen years of hating, resenting, and "disproving" God. I solved problems through drugs, alcohol, and manipulation. Sadly enough, these <em>problems</em> were all in my head. Many of these struggles were figmented by my own mind - purley to distance myself from any theologic beliefs and believers.I loathed the Christians around me because of their <strong>imaginary, hateful, sky-daddy</strong>. Despite this, here I am, starting a blog to bring glory to God. So what happened? I press on...</p>
	
	<h2 style="text-align: left;"> Part Two: Finding Christ</h2>
		<p style="left-margin: 25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a friend - absolutely loving, serving, beautiful heart - and she was a believer (<em>the only one I could stand</em>). She did what every Christian is called to do, and tried sharing the Gospel with me. Me being me, though, turned down any of her advances into my spiriftual life. Youth Group, Sunday church, hangouts, you name it - I refused to compromise my own beliefs (<em>or lack thereof</em>) to stoop to her level. However, even through my stubborn this, when I invited my friend to try our school band, she accepted without mental reservation because <strong> she chose to care about what I cared about with grace.</strong> Now, this really struck me as odd. "<em>I've done nothing but reject her, but she comes to help me when I needed it.</em>" Another opportunity rolled around for her - <em>Silver Ring Thing</em> - and to "repay" her kindness, I (<em>relectuantly</em>) joined her. To keep this story short, I'll summarize: <em>discomfort and conviction gave way to grace, salvation, and relief.</em> At 17 years old on October 20, 2016, I was born again in Christ, Jesus.</p>
		
	<h2 style="text-align: left;"> Part Three: Life with Christ</h2>
		<p style="left-margin: 25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was set free that night. One benefit to being an Athiest beforehand - I knew what kind of Christian <strong>not to be</strong>. I didn't want to be a <em>Sunday-Morning Christan, a Chreaster, a Frozen Saved, or a Watered-down-Christian.</em> In essence, I didn't want an asterisck next to the phrase "saved through Christ." The change was radical and the peace was real. Of course, I'm far from perfect and still but a spiritual infant. I started this blog to keep me accountable, profess my faith, and help others in their own walks with Christ.</p>
